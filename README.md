# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline - Ansible, Docker, Github Webhooks on AWS 








we will create CI/CD Pipeline using Github Jenkins Ansible and Docker
we will push code to github and from which we will pull through the jenkins using the webhooks so basically what webhooks do
is whenever an event is triggered on the github it will trigger another event on the jenkins and which will pull the code from the github
and then we will execute ansible playbook using which will deploy the container to our remote server
